# Cool Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to the Cool Interactive Portfolio project! This project showcases a modern web application that integrates a visually appealing frontend with a robust backend. The application features advanced functionalities such as drag-and-drop capabilities, animated components, and an AI chat interface.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React and Vite. It includes:

- **Public Assets**: Contains the main HTML file and favicon.
- **Components**: Reusable UI components such as buttons, cards, and layout elements.
- **Features**: Specialized components for drag-and-drop functionality, animated cards, and AI chat integration.
- **Pages**: Different pages of the application including Home, Projects, and AI Playground.
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for managing state and API interactions.
- **Services**: Functions for making API calls to the backend.
- **Styles**: Global styles for consistent design across the application.

### Backend

The backend is built using TypeScript and provides a RESTful API. It includes:

- **Controllers**: Handle requests related to authentication, projects, and AI functionalities.
- **Middleware**: Authentication and error handling middleware.
- **Models**: Data models for users and projects.
- **Routes**: API routes for handling requests.
- **Services**: Functions for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- **Configuration**: Settings for the backend application.

## Features

- **Beautiful Designs**: The frontend is designed with modern UI principles to provide an engaging user experience.
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can easily rearrange items using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Animated Cards**: Cards that animate on interaction to enhance visual appeal.
- **AI Integration**: A chat interface that connects to an AI service for interactive experiences.
